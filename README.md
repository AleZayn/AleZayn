## Hey, I'm Ali Zain! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently on the path of front-end development with a strong skill set in JavaScript. I am based in Vicenza. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

Since February 2023, I have been living and learning web development, striving to create modern and user-friendly interfaces. My goal is to contribute to making this world a little better through JavaScript code. :collision:

> I am deeply committed to embracing the "Keep it simple, stupid" (KISS) principle, as I prioritize continuous learning in coding. I believe in the power of simplicity and strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I am always seeking opportunities to grow and learn something new. Currently, my main focus is on improving my JavaScript skills.
